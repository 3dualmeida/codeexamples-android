Exercise 1:
-----------
	In this exercise we will create new Android Test Project.

Steps:
	1. Open menu File - New - Other ... - Android / Android Test Project
	2. * Project Name: "com.vogella.android.test.fileaccess.test"
       * Select "com.vogella.android.test.fileaccess" as the project to test
	     Press Next
	   * Select fitting Android version
	     Press Finish
	     

Exercise 2:
-----------
	In this exercise we will create a simple JUnit test case and mock the Contenxt
	We will extend standard junit.framework.TestCase.
	
Steps:
	1. Continue to work with 
	   the "com.vogella.android.test.fileaccess.test" project in this exercise.
	2. Create new FileTest class 
	3. Create new public testFileApplication() method. In this method we will test the
	   Util.writeConfiguration(context) implementation.
	4. Write your MockOutputStream extends FileOutputStream which which in its write() 
	   function remembers how often it has called this. 
	   
	   Constructor:
	   
		public MockOutputStream() throws FileNotFoundException {	       
			super(FileDescriptor.out);
		}
	5. Create a MockContext and override the openFileOutput() using your MockOutputStream
	6. Assert that write was not called before you call Util.writeConfiguration(context) and twice aftewards


Exercise 3:
-----------
	In this exercise we will create a simple Android Unit Test for our StringListAdapter 
	class. For that we will extend android.test.AndroidTestCase. This class will allows
	us to use Android context class in our tests. 

Steps:
	1. Copy /exercises/02/SimpleAndroidTestCase.java file located in 
	   com.vogella.android.countries project to "src/com/vogella/android/countries/test" folder
	   of com.vogella.android.countries.test.
	2. Solve all TODO's in the test file.
	3. Execute all tests and make sure test case runs with no errors.
